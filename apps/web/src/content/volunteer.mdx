# Volunteer Team

Our events would not be possible without help of many volunteers.

If you are in need of hours for school credits or to fulfill volunteer hours for fire fighting or police requirements, or simply want to help and be a part of a great event, please contact us via email or phone.

Your help will be greatly appreciated and you will be provided a snack. If required you will get a confirmation letter outlining your responsibilities and hours completed during the event.

To register as volunteer please fill out the Volunteer Sign up form (click here) and our Volunteer Coordinator will contact you with the details regarding the event and your placement.
